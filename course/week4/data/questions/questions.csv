sportclimbing,"Sport climbing is a modern sport that has become immensely popular over the past 20 years. It is a young, mixed-gender sport – with 39 per cent of climbers under 18 years old – practised both outdoors and in a more urban format indoors. There are over 25 million climbers in 150 countries all over the world.

In 1985, a group of climbers gathered in Bardonecchia, near Turin, Italy, for an event called “SportRoccia”, which became the first organised lead competition in which competitors climb within a certain time limit. One year later, the first competition event on an artificial climbing wall was organised in Vaulx-en-Velin near Lyon, France.",Where was the first competition event on an artificial climbing wall organized in 1986?,5,Germany
sportclimbing,"Brief Overview of the Rules

At the Olympics, sport climbing involves three formats : bouldering, speed and lead. In bouldering, athletes climb 4.5 m high walls without ropes, in a limited period of time and in the fewest attempts possible. Speed is a spectacular race against the clock in one-on-one elimination rounds that combine precision and explosivity. The best athletes scale a 15m high and five degrees inclinated wall in under six seconds for men and under seven seconds for women.

In the lead event, athletes climb as high as they can on a wall over 15m high in six minutes without having seen the route ahead of time. The routes for this event are more and more complex and challenging during the event, requiring all of the athletes’ physical and mental ability.

In Tokyo, each athlete competed in all three disciplines and the final scores reflected the combined results of the three competitions. The climber with the lowest score took home the first Olympic gold medal in the history of sport climbing.

In Paris 2024, two competitions will crown their own olympic champion in sport climbing. One will be a combined competition of bouldering and lead events, and the second one will only feature a speed event.",How will the Olympic sport climbing competition differ in Paris 2024 compared to Tokyo?,5,"The Olympic sport climbing competition in Paris 2024 will include a new format called ""Olympic Combined,"" which combines three disciplines - speed climbing, bouldering, and lead climbing - into one event. This is different from Tokyo 2020, where the sport climbing competition consisted of separate events for each discipline."

Sport climbing took its first steps on the Olympic stage at the Buenos Aires Youth Olympic Games, in 2018. The event had not been highly publicised but the public was impressed by the spectacle and the suspense of this exciting sport. A hit at the youth events, sport climbing then made its debut at the Tokyo 2020 Games, joining the Olympic programme as a new sport.

The originality of these events as well as the discipline’s visual, aesthetic and exciting nature make it a very popular and widely-practised sport for young people that can take place in very diverse environments, urban or natural. Sport climbing will also be one of the four additional sports of Paris 2024 alongside breaking (making its Olympic debut), surfing and skateboarding, and it also will be part of the programme for the Los Angeles 2028 Olympic Games.",When did sport climbing make its debut on the Olympic stage at the Buenos Aires Youth Olympic Games?,5,Sport climbing made its debut on the Olympic stage at the Buenos Aires Youth Olympic Games in 2018.
flagfootball,"Flag football is a variant of American football (or gridiron) where the aim is to advance up the pitch via a series of offensive plays into the opposition’s defensive endzone.

flagfootball,"What are the rules of Flag Football?

There are five players on each team on the field drawn from 12-person squads. Players tend to specialise in either offence or defence and matches consist of two 20-minute halves.

A flag football pitch measures 70 x 30 yards (64m x 27.4m) with 10 yards (9.1m) allotted to each of the two endzones.

Play starts at the team's own five-yard line with the centre snapping the ball back to the quarterback who either passes the ball forward to try and find a receiver, or hands off to a running back.

The play is over when either a flag is removed, the ball-carrier goes out of bounds, or a forward pass hits the ground.

The team on offence has four attempts - known as downs - to go from their own five-yard line to halfway. If successful, they have another four downs to reach the endzone and score a touchdown. If unsuccessful on either count, the ball is turned over to the opposition who start on their own five-yard line.

After a touchdown, worth six points, teams go for an extra point - by running or passing - from the five-yard line, or two extra points from the 10-yard line.

If the scores are tied after 40 minutes, sudden-death overtime begins with the first team to score taking victory.",How many players are on each team in a game of Flag Football?,5,Flag football is typically played with 5 players on each team.

archery,"Brief Overview of the Rules

Targets are 122cm in diameter and positioned 70m away from the archers, who must shoot their arrows as close to the centre of the target as possible in order to beat their opponents. Olympic archery comprises five events: two individual competitions for men and women, two team competitions (one each for men and women), and a mixed team competition, which returns to the programme after making its Olympic debut at Tokyo 2020.

Archery requires great concentration and dexterity; archers must overcome their nerves as a single mistake can prove costly in competition. Individual competitions at the Games begin with the ranking round, where each of the 64 archers shoot 72 arrows to determine their ranking for the single-elimination bracket. The athletes compete in this knockout system until the final according to their ranking, with the top‑ranked archer facing off against the 64th‑ranked archer, the second‑ranked against the 63rd‑ranked, and so on.

The team event uses the same ranking results from the individual competition to determine seeding for the teams; the top four teams receive a bye into the quarterfinals, while the rest of the field competes in a single-elimination bracket. The mixed team event also uses the results of the ranking round to qualify and seed teams.",How does the ranking round work in individual archery competitions at the Olympics?,5,"In individual archery competitions at the Olympics, the ranking round is the first stage where each archer shoots a total of 72 arrows.

cricket,"What are the rules of Cricket?

Each team has 11 players with one side batting and the other fielding. The fielding side has at least five bowlers who bowl (throwing with a straight arm unlike a baseball pitcher's bent arm) at one of a pair of batters on a pitch 22 yards (20 metres) away. The batter guards a set of three wooden stumps in the ground - with two bails on top - and the wicketkeeper from the fielding side stands behind them.

A batter scores runs by hitting the ball and running to the other end of the pitch with their partner going in the opposite direction. If they score an odd number of runs, their partner faces the next ball. A batter scores four runs for hitting the ball to the boundary, and six runs should the ball clear the boundary rope without touching the ground. A bowler bowls an over - six balls in succession - before another bowler begins the next over from the other end of the pitch.

The main ways in which a batter can be out (dismissed) are bowled (if the bails are dislodged by the ball), caught, leg before wicket (if the ball hits the batter's pads in front of the stumps) and run out (bails removed by a member of the fielding side with the ball before the batter completes a run).

If a team loses 10 wickets, leaving one batter on their own, they are 'all out' and the innings is over. In T20, the innings is usually complete at the end of 20 overs. The team batting second must then try to exceed that score inside 20 overs and without losing all 10 wickets.

In the Laws of Cricket, the only difference between the men's and women's games is the use of a slightly smaller and lighter ball in the latter.",What are the main ways in which a batter can be dismissed in the game of Cricket?,5,"A batter can be dismissed in cricket through several ways:
1. Bowled - when the bowler bowls the ball and it hits the wickets, resulting in the batter being out. 
2. Caught - when a fielder catches the ball hit by the batter before it touches the ground.
3. LBW (Leg Before Wicket) - when the ball hits the batter's leg before hitting the bat and would have gone on to hit the stumps.
4. Run Out - when the fielding team hits the wickets with the ball while the batter is out of their crease.
5. Stumped - when the wicketkeeper catches the ball and removes the bails while the batter is out of their crease.
6. Hit wicket - when the batter accidentally knocks over their own stumps while playing a shot.
7. Handled the ball - when the batter deliberately touches the ball with their hand. 
8. Obstructing the field - when the batter obstructs a fielder while attempting to run."

skateboarding,"Brief Overview of the Rules

The world’s greatest skateboarders will face each other at the Olympic Games, competing in the two most popular and spectacular disciplines: park and street. Athletes must carry out their most impressive tricks, meeting criteria for the degree of difficulty, speed and range of moves.

The events consist of two rounds: prelims and finals.

The park competition takes place on a varied course combining bowls and numerous bends, which the athletes use to gather speed and perform tricks mid-air.

The skateboarders are judged by the height and speed of the tricks they carry out during jumps, as well as their capacity to use the entire surface and all obstacles. They perform three 45‑second runs, with the best of three counting as their final round score.

Street events take place on a straight ‘street-like’ course with stairs, handrails, etc. set up to resemble the urban environments where skateboarding started out. Athletes perform a range of tricks and are also judged on how they control their board during the two 45‑second runs and five tricks they carry out.",What criteria are used to judge skateboarders in the park and street disciplines at the Olympic Games?,5,"Skateboarders in the park and street disciplines at the Olympic Games are judged based on criteria such as difficulty of tricks, variety of tricks performed, style, execution, use of the course obstacles, flow, and overall creativity."

squash,"By whom, where and when was Squash invented?

Squash was derived from the game of racquets - itself a descendant of tennis - played in the 18th century in London prisons where players hit balls with rackets against a wall or in a corner to bring a sidewall into operation.

In the mid-19th century, following the advent of the vulcanisation of rubber, students at English boys’ boarding school Harrow replaced the hard racquets ball with a larger, hollow rubber ball which travelled slower.

Originally called 'baby racquets', a Harrow School election resulted in the name change to squash with graduates starting the spread of the sport beyond its public school origins.","When did students at Harrow School replace the hard racquets ball with a larger, hollow rubber ball, leading to the creation of the game of squash?",5,"The students at Harrow School replaced the hard racquets ball with a larger, hollow rubber ball in the mid-19th century, thus leading to the creation of the game of squash."

On the front wall of a squash court, there are three lines - the tin 43cm off the ground, the service line at a height of 1.78m, and the out line at 4.57m which slopes down on the side walls to 2.13m on the back wall.

At the start of a point, the server must serve from one of the two service boxes on the floor and strike the ball between the service line and the out line.

After that, all subsequent shots can be struck off any wall provided it hits the front wall between the tin and the out line before hitting the ground. The ball is only permitted to bounce once on the floor.

The winner of a rally receives a point and the next serve. The first player to 11 points - by two clear points - wins a game. The first player to three games takes the match.",What are the rules regarding serving in a game of Squash?,5,The rules regarding serving in a game of Squash require the server to stand in one of the two service boxes and hit the ball directly to the front wall above the service line.

baseballsoftball,Baseball and softball are two related ball sports played between two teams on a diamond-shaped field.,What are baseball and softball?,5,"Baseball and softball are both sports played with a bat and ball on a field. They involve two teams taking turns batting and fielding, with the goal of scoring runs by hitting the ball and running around bases. Although they have similar rules and objectives, softball is generally played with a larger ball on a smaller field with underhand pitching, while baseball is played with a smaller ball on a larger field with overhand pitching."

While there are world championships for both men and women in both sports, at the Olympic level baseball has been a men's-only sport while softball has been a women's-only sport. There are differences in the number of players on each team between the two sports, the size of the field, and in some rules.

Softball pitchers are also required to throw underhand, and most pitchers throw using the windmill pitch style, where the ball is thrown after rotating in a large circle. In softball, top female pitchers can reach speeds of over 100km/h. That speed fits with the fast-paced nature of the game. Since the bases aren’t as far apart, there is a shorter pitching distance. The game is also shorter in duration to baseball, with only seven innings compared to baseball’s nine.",What are the key differences in pitching style and speed between baseball and softball?,5,"In general, fastpitch softball pitchers tend to pitch underhand at faster speeds compared to baseball pitchers who pitch overhand. Additionally, softball pitchers often use windmill pitching techniques to generate speed and movement on the ball, while baseball pitchers focus more on different types of pitches like curveballs, sliders, and changeups. Fastpitch softball pitchers also release the ball closer to the batter, resulting in less reaction time for the hitter compared to baseball pitchers."
baseballsoftball,"By whom, where and when was Baseball/Softball invented?

The earliest record of the game of ""baseball"" being played was in Surrey, England, in 1749. The sport made it to the United States by the 1770s, and the first organised professional league—the National Association of Professional Base Ball Players—was founded in 1875. Baseball is considered ""America's past-time"".

Softball was first imagined as “indoor baseball” in 1887 in Chicago, Illinois, by reporter George Hancock after watching someone hit a boxing glove with a broom handle. He went on to publish rules for the game and later took it outside, playing on fields too small for baseball. While the rules remained vague, interest in the game grew, and more than 100 area high school teams were formed by 1892.

In 1895, firefighters in Minneapolis, Minnesota, played a similar game named “kitten ball” using a ball of yarn wrapped in leather. In 1907, a guide for indoor baseball published by Albert Spalding allowed for game flexibility with two constants: a larger ball than baseball as well as underhand pitching. In 1926, Walter Hakanson proposed unifying the disparate versions of the game into one, under a single name: Softball.","When was the sport of baseball first played in Surrey, England?",1,"The sport of baseball was first played in Surrey, England in the mid-18th century, around the 1750s."

judo,"Brief Overview of the Rules

The objective of judo is to throw your opponent to the ground, immobilise them with a pinning hold or force them into submission with a joint lock or choke. There are two types of scores in judo:

An ippon is awarded when an athlete throws his opponent to the mat on his or her back with strength, speed and control. An ippon can also be awarded through submission or by pinning an opponent to the ground for 20 seconds. If a judoka achieves ippon, they immediately win the match.

A waza-ari is awarded for a throw that isn’t clear enough to be an ippon (either because it lacked speed or force, or the opponent did not land primarily on their back) or when an   opponent is pinned down for less than 20 seconds (but longer than 10 seconds). Two waza‑ari in one match is the equivalent of an ippon and immediately ends the match.

Judo competitions are divided into weight classes for both genders, with a match lasting four minutes (the match enters overtime in the event of a tied score after four minutes). Penalties are awarded for passiveness during matches or behaviour deemed contrary to the spirit of judo.","What is the difference between an ippon and a waza-ari in judo, and how do they affect the outcome of a match?",5,"In judo, an ippon is a full point awarded for a technique executed with efficiency and control, resulting in a clear victory.

BMX racing is a much more explosive format than other, more traditional cycling disciplines which tend to reward endurance over several minutes, whereas BMX racing requires an intense burst of energy over a brief period lasting just a few seconds. Sprint races are contested by a maximum of eight riders on a track packed with jumps, banked corners and obstacles, where the rider with the quickest reactions and fastest pace wins.

Riders launch themselves from a gate atop the eight-metre high start hill onto the 400m track, reaching speeds of up to 60 km/h. Quick reactions and explosive power are essential to burst out of the gate at the front of the pack and hold on to the lead through to the finish line. The final race is often a thrilling spectacle that viewers watch with bated breath.",What are the key attributes needed for success in BMX racing?,5,"Some key attributes needed for success in BMX racing include physical strength, agility, balance, speed, mental focus, determination, and strategic thinking."

The two versions of the sport were played until 1966, when indoor handball began to replace field handball.",Who introduced handball to Sweden in 1910?,5,The Swedish teacher Konrad Kalteiski is believed to have introduced handball to Sweden in 1910.
handball,"Brief Overview of the Rules

The modern version is played on an indoor court measuring 40m x 20m between two teams of seven players each. Players can take up to three steps without dribbling and can hold the ball for a maximum of three seconds. The team with the most goals at the end of the two 30-minute halves wins. Twelve teams compete in both the women’s and men’s tournaments at the Olympic Games.

Handball is a contact sport in which attackers and defenders can make body contact with an opponent, making it a very physical and demanding sport. Offensive strategies are even encouraged, as passive play is illegal. Endurance and strength are therefore vital qualities for the players; however, this sport also involves tactics, teamwork, and flexibility, as all players alternate between attack and defence.",How many players are on each team in a handball match?,5,There are 7 players on each team in a handball match.

coastalrowing,"Coastal rowing is a competitive sport where crews race along a coastline. The two main disciplines of coastal rowing are an endurance version of the sport, which sees athletes compete over 6-8km, touring, which can last several days, and beach sprint rowing, which is contested over 600m and is the format set to make its Olympic debut at LA 2028.

Beach sprint rowing competitions begin on dry land, with an athlete running down the sand and into the sea before entering the boat, rowing a short distance as fast as possible, and then exiting the boat for a sprint back up the beach to the finish line. Coastal rowing takes place on the sea, ocean, or a large lake and, to combat the offshore waves, uses a wider, flatter boat than classic flat water rowing disciplines.",What is the format of beach sprint rowing competitions in coastal rowing?,5,"In beach sprint rowing competitions in coastal rowing, the format typically involves rowing small boats or gig boats in a straight line along the shore for a certain distance, often with a sprint finish.

Beach sprint rowing races are usually 600m in total length. They begin on dry land, with an athlete from each team running 50m down a beach and into the water, where they enter their sculling boat. Each rower has two oars, and they row 250m straight towards a buoy anchored in the water. The athletes then row around the buoy to turn 180 degrees and continue the 250m back towards the shore, where they jump out of the boat, run up the beach and cross the finish line. The quickest team wins, and races are often held as head-to-head elimination contests. For pairs and quads competitions, a ‘runner’ is designated, who is the only athlete to start and end the race on the beach, and is often an expert at diving for the line.",What is the total length of beach sprint rowing races in Coastal Rowing and describe the race format?,5,"The total length of beach sprint rowing races in Coastal Rowing is typically around 500 meters.

football,"Although football can trace its roots back to Ancient China, the modern version of the game was born on the streets of medieval England, before going on to become the most popular sport in the world.

The (very) early games of football in medieval England involved a large mass of people who would attempt to drag a pig’s bladder—by any means possible—to markers at opposing ends of a town. Such events were well known for being as violent as they were popular. In the 16th century, English schools established the modern football codes, thereby transforming what were mob riots into a proper sport.",How did the modern version of football originate in medieval England?,5,"The modern version of football originated in medieval England through a combination of mob football games played in towns and villages, the incorporation of rules by various schools and institutions, and the establishment of the Football Association in 1863 to standardize the game."

In the late 1980s, Italian coach Simonetta Montagni began developing handball on the beach. As the discipline began to grow in popularity, coach Luciano Bartolini was asked to create the first set of rules for the game in 1990, making the fast-paced game fit within the existing beach volleyball court lines.

In 2000, beach handball became an official European Handball Federation (EHF) sport, and the first EHF Beach Handball European Championship was held that year in Gaeta, Italy. The sport was further developed with representatives of the International Handball Federation (IHF), and it began to reach a global audience.

beachhandball,"Beach and Indoor Differences

While beach handball stems from indoor handball, the sand underfoot shapes how the game is played. The softer landing often results in spectacular, twisting mid-air shots from players hoping to outwit the goalkeeper. Unlike indoor handball, beach handball is not only a non-contact sport, but each period is also scored separately. The winner of a period is awarded one point. Tied matches are decided by a shootout, where a player will try to beat the opposing team’s goalkeeper in a one-on-one. In the shootouts, each team gets five initial attempts. If the scores remained tied, sudden death decides the winner.",How is a tied match in beach handball typically decided?,5,"A tied match in beach handball is typically decided by a shoot-out, similar to penalty shootouts in soccer. Each team takes turns shooting from the penalty line, with the team scoring the most goals being declared the winner."
beachhandball,"The Basics

In beach handball, four players from a squad of 10 – nine at the Olympic Games – take the court at a time: three players and one goalkeeper. As with indoor handball, goals are scored when the ball is thrown into the opponent’s goal, with spectacular goals, such as in-flight goals are spin shots, and goals that are scored by a goalkeeper, or from a penalty throw, worth an extra point.

beachvolleyball,"Brief Overview of the Rules

Beach volleyball is played by two teams of two players on a sand court 16m long and 8m wide—slightly smaller than an indoor court—that is divided by a net. Beach volleyball uses the same net height as indoor volleyball: 2.24m for women and 2.43m for men.

The first team to win two sets wins the match. The first two sets are played to 21 points each and the third set, if necessary, is played to 15 points. As there are only two players per team, players have a lot more ground to cover, which means they need lightning-fast reflexes. Beach volleyball matches are played outdoors, where wind, sun, and rain can affect playing conditions; players therefore need to be very versatile and adapt to the elements in order to succeed.",What are the dimensions of a beach volleyball court and the height of the net for men and women?,5,"The dimensions of a beach volleyball court are 16m x 8m, and the height of the net is 2.43m for men and 2.24m for women."

Boxing seemed to disappear with the fall of the Roman Empire before resurfacing in the 17th century in England, where records of amateur boxing began in 1880. Initially, five weight categories were contested: bantam, not exceeding 54 kilos; feather, not exceeding 57 kilos; light, not exceeding 63.5 kilos; middle, not exceeding 73 kilos; and heavy, any weight.",What were the original weight categories for boxing when it was first introduced to the ancient Olympic Games in 688 BC?,1,"The original weight categories for boxing in the ancient Olympic Games in 688 BC were likely not as organized as the modern weight classes we have today.

This could have included categories such as light, middle, and heavyweight, but the specific details may have varied."
boxing,"Brief Overview of the Rules

Olympic boxing is governed by a special set of rules. Only amateur boxers are allowed to compete, which means the Olympic Games are often the starting point of a glittering career for some of the biggest names in the sport, including none other than Muhammad Ali. Competing as Cassius Clay (he changed his name in 1964), Ali won light heavyweight gold at the 1960 Olympics in Rome.

Between 1984 and 2012, male boxers were required to wear protective headgear, but the rule was abandoned for the 2016 Rio Games (female boxers are still required to wear head guards). Each bout is disputed over three rounds of three minutes each for men, and four rounds of two minutes each for women. At the end of every round, each of the judges determine a winner based on the judging criteria and award the victor 10 points for the round. The loser of the round can be awarded anywhere between seven to nine points based on the level of performance in that round.

fencing,"Brief Overview of the Rules

In fencing, two competitors, each holding a weapon in one hand, face each other to strike their opponent on a valid target area of the body. The rules differ according to the type of weapon used. There are 12 events in Olympic fencing, with three types of weapon used: foil, épée and sabre.

Hits made with the point (tip), edge, or back of the blade are counted as valid in sabre, with the target area including the entire torso above the waist, as well as the head and arms. In épée and foil, fencers only score when they strike their opponent with the point of their weapon. In épée the target area covers the entire body from the mask down to the feet, while in foil the target area is the trunk only (torso, shoulders and neck). The first fencer to reach 15 points, or scores the most points at the completion of three three-minute rounds, wins the match.

Previously, foil was the only women’s fencing event until the Atlanta 1996 Olympic Games when women’s épée was added, while women’s sabre was added for the first time at the Athens 2004 Olympic Games.

Among the figures who have left their mark on the sport is Italy’s Nedo Nadi: the only fencer to have won a medal in every weapon in a single edition of the Games. In 1912, at 18 years old, he won gold in the foil.

Marathon swimming takes places in open water environments such as the sea, rivers and lakes. Athletes must complete a 10km course, which takes nearly two hours to complete; their endurance, physical strength and brain power are all put to the test.

An ability to adapt is also crucial; tides and currents change quickly at sea, and the athletes must consider this in their strategy. Using the right tactics for the course and conditions is therefore key. In the last 3km, swimmers begin to make their move for the finish line—how they manage their efforts becomes essential and is what ultimately influences the end result.",What distance must athletes complete in a marathon swimming race?,5,Approximately 10 kilometers or 6.2 miles.

Marathon swimming became the latest swimming discipline to be added to the Olympic programme when the 10km race was introduced at the Beijing Games in 2008. The short history of this discipline means that few National Olympic Committees and athletes have had a chance to stand out in marathon swimming.

Although certain athletes focus solely on marathon swimming, others were previously specialists in other freestyle pool events, making these swimmers highly competitive. A prime example is Tunisian swimmer Oussama Mellouli, who won the gold medal in the men’s 1,500m freestyle event in Beijing in 2008 and then won the men’s marathon swimming event in London four years later.",When was marathon swimming added to the Olympic programme?,5,Marathon swimming was added to the Olympic programme in 2008.

During the 19th century, cycling enjoyed a surge in popularity thanks to the invention of the chain-and-gearing system. The first races were organised a few years later, with the first documented event held in 1868 in Parc de Saint Cloud in Paris. Shortly thereafter, national cycling federations began to be established and an international federation, known as the Union Cycliste Internationale, was set up in 1900 to oversee the organisation of the various disciplines.",When was the first documented cycling race held and where?,5,"The first documented cycling race was held on May 31, 1868, in Parc de Saint-Cloud, Paris, France."
cyclingroad,"Brief Overview of the Rules

Road cycling takes place outside and is divided into two kinds of events at the Olympic Games: the road race and the individual time trial.

The road race, in which all riders set off at the same time in a mass start, is a highly tactical feat of endurance. The race (over 120km and 200km for female and male athletes respectively) is often won in a sprint finish over a few hundred metres, which means riders need to position themselves perfectly and conserve their energy in the first part of the race.

The time trial is a solo effort in which competitors set off at staggered times rather than in a grouped peloton. They cover a much shorter distance than that of the road race, as the time trial rarely exceeds 50km. Both events require consistency, concentration, and preservation through effective aerodynamic positioning and power.",What are the two kinds of road cycling events at the Olympic Games?,5,The two kinds of road cycling events at the Olympic Games are road race and individual time trial.

Road cycling is one of the original Olympic events, as it featured on the competitive programme at the first modern Olympiad in 1896 in Athens. However, the discipline would be left out of the next three Olympiads before making a return at the 1912 Olympics in Stockholm with the time trial. Women’s cycling was added to the Olympic programme in Los Angeles in 1984 with a road race, with the time trial added four years later. Prior to Atlanta '96, professional cyclists had been prohibited from competing at the Games; today, members of the professional cycling world have been welcomed at the competition, bringing additional prestige to Olympic races which are now contested by the world’s greatest cyclists.",When was women's cycling added to the Olympic programme?,5,Women's cycling was added to the Olympic programme in 1984.

Sailing involves moving a boat solely by harnessing the power of the wind. Mastery over ever‑changing conditions requires both great skill and experience on the part of the athletes. In Olympic events, the rules of the international sailing federation, World Sailing, apply. Competitions are made up of fleet racing, where two equally-matched boats race around the same varied course.

There were ten events at the Tokyo Games, including windsurfing, mixed Nacra 17 Foiling, 49ers and the 470. The various sailing disciplines are constantly changing, and boats are designed to be increasingly small and lightweight, placing ever greater demands on both the athletic and technical capacities of the sailors.

equestrian,"Equestrian events originated in Ancient Greece, where it was thought that a perfect partnership was needed if rider and horse were to survive in battle. Dressage was therefore developed as a way of training horses for war. Equestrian events appeared at the ancient Olympic Games as chariot racing, which was a daring and exciting spectacle. The art of riding then fell into oblivion until its revival during the Renaissance. Dressage reached its peak with the creation of the world-famous Spanish Riding School in Vienna in 1729, which established the foundations of the modern discipline.",What was the purpose of developing dressage in Ancient Greece?,5,The purpose of developing dressage in Ancient Greece was to improve the training and discipline of horses for use in the military and for various equestrian competitions.
equestrian,"Brief Overview of the Rules

Equestrian comprises three disciplines at the Games, with men and women competing on equal terms.

In the jumping discipline, riders and horses are timed as they jump over obstacles, with time penalties imposed for each obstacle toppled. Agility, technique and harmony between horse and rider are essential.

Dressage is the most advanced form of horse training, where horse and rider perform a series of artistic movements to music. Judges evaluate the ease and fluidity with which they move around the course.

The third discipline of eventing resembles an equestrian triathlon. It combines the two other events—jumping and dressage—with a third: cross-country, which consists of a long course combining solid and natural obstacles, drawing on the athletes’ endurance and experience. The horse and rider with the most versatile skills win the three events.",What are the three disciplines of equestrian at the Games?,5,"The three disciplines of equestrian at the Games are dressage, show jumping, and eventing."

Short track (or indoor) speed skating began in Canada and the United States of America, where they held mass-start competitions on an oval track as early as 1905-1906. The lack of 400m long tracks led many North American skaters to practice on ice rinks. However, practicing on a smaller track brought new challenges, like tighter turns and shorter straightaways, which lead to different techniques in order to win on a shorter track. These countries began competing against each other on an annual basis. The sport’s rise in popularity was partly thanks to the North American racing rules, which introduced a “pack” style of racing. Capitalising on this, the organisers of the 1932 Lake Placid Games, with the consent of the International Skating Union (ISU), agreed to follow these rules for the programme’s speed skating events.",How did the lack of 400m long tracks in Canada and the United States lead to the development of indoor speed skating competitions?,5,"The lack of 400m long outdoor tracks in Canada and the United States likely led to the development of indoor speed skating competitions as a way to provide skaters with a suitable venue to train and compete. Skate length tracks typically range from 200-250 meters. Indoor competitions also allow for more control over environmental factors such as temperature and wind, which can affect outdoor races."

Volleyball is played by two teams of six players on an indoor court 18m long and 9m wide. Matches are played to the best of five sets. A point is scored when the ball lands within the court boundaries or when a playing error is made. The first team to score 25 points by a two-point margin wins the set, with each match following a best-of-five sets format. If required, a fifth set is played to 15 points (a winning margin of two points is still required). 

In a game of volleyball, the ball can reach speeds of up to 130km/h, particularly following a spectacular jump serve or smash.

Modern pentathlon is made up of four events combining five sports:

- Riding, with a show jumping course on an unfamiliar horse that the athlete is allocated in a draw just 20 minutes before they compete.
- Fencing, which is split into two rounds: a ranking round where each athlete competes against each other athlete in a bout lasting one minute or until the first hit, and a second round based on the results of the first round. The format of the second round is single elimination, with each bout lasting 45 seconds. Points are scored for winning each bout.
- Swimming, with a 200m freestyle event.
- Running and shooting, with a laser-run where athletes alternate between running and shooting at five targets from a distance of 10m.
The modern pentathlon is divided into two sections. Firstly, athletes score points according to how they rank in the fencing, riding and swimming events, which decide their starting position for the laser run event. Secondly, during the laser-run, athletes start with a delay corresponding to the number of points between them and the leader. The first athlete to cross the finish line in the laser-run wins the gold medal.

Due to the diverse nature of the events involved, modern pentathlon is an extremely demanding sport that pushes athletes to their mental and physical limits and requires an exceptional variety of skills.",How is the winner of the modern pentathlon determined?,5,"The winner of the modern pentathlon is determined by a points system based on performances in five different disciplines: fencing, swimming, equestrian show jumping, and a combined event of pistol shooting and cross-country running. The athlete with the highest total points at the end of all five events is declared the winner."
modernpentathlon,"Olympic History

Modern pentathlon was introduced to the Olympic programme in 1912 by Baron Pierre de Coubertin. Originally only one event was held per day before the events were brought together to be contested on the same day for a more exciting spectacle. The women’s event was introduced at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney. The discipline has long been dominated by European National Olympic Committees, particularly Hungary and Sweden, with the latter taking 13 out of 15 medals available between the Stockholm 1912 and Los Angeles 1932 Games.",Which European countries have historically dominated the sport of modern pentathlon in the Olympics?,5,"Hungary, Sweden, and Russia have historically dominated the sport of modern pentathlon in the Olympics."

karate,"What are the different types of Karate? What are the rules of Karate?

Karate comprises two modalities: Kumite and Kata. In Kumite, or combat, the winner of the three-minute fights is the one who obtains a clear lead of eight points, or the competitor having the highest number of points at time-up. If the fight is a draw, then the winner is determined by the first unopposed point advantage (Senshu) or in the case of a scoreless result, by a majority decision of the judges (Hantei).

Points are scored according to correctly-executed techniques of controlled punches, strikes and kicks.

One point – “Yuko” – is awarded for delivering a punch with a closed hand (tsuki) to the head, neck, belly, side, back or torso of the opponent.

Two points – “Waza-ari” – are awarded for a kick to the body.

Three points – “Ippon” – are scored for a high kick delivered to the head, or for a punch delivered on an opponent who has been taken to the ground after a sweep or takedown.

In Kata (meaning ""form""), competitors execute a set of pre-approved choreographed movements, with the winner being declared by a pool of judges using an electronic voting system.

Karateka are evaluated according to technical and athletic performances.",What are the different ways in which points can be scored in Karate Kumite competitions?,5,"Points can be scored in Karate Kumite competitions through techniques such as punches, kicks, and strikes to specific target areas on the opponent's body. Points can also be scored for effective control, timing, and technique displayed during the match."

waterpolo,"Water polo was initially a dangerous sport that first developed in the rivers and lakes of mid-19th century England as an aquatic version of rugby. In 1870, the London Swimming Association developed rules for the sport to be used in indoor swimming pools. Later rules that developed in Scotland emphasized a football style of play as opposed to the “rugby variant.” Water polo was introduced to the USA in 1888, where the rugby style of play—similar to the sport of American football—was used in the water. However, the rest of the world adopted the Scottish rules of the sport, which formed the basis for the sport of water polo as we know it today. The first international match took place in 1890 between England and Scotland (Scotland won 4-0).","What were the rules of water polo adopted by the rest of the world, which formed the basis for the sport as we know it today?",5,"The rules of water polo adopted by the rest of the world, which formed the basis for the sport as we know it today, were primarily developed by the London Water Recreation Committee in the late 19th century. These rules included guidelines for team composition, field dimensions, scoring, and gameplay regulations."
waterpolo,"Brief Overview of the Rules

Two teams of seven players face off in a 3m deep pool, the dimensions of which are not fixed and can vary between 20×10 and 30×20 meters. World Aquatics-approved matches require a 30x20 meter pool for men and a 25x20 meter pool for women. Matches consist of four eight-minute quarters. Other than the goalkeeper, players may only hold the ball with one hand. Possession lasts 30 seconds; if the team does not attempt a shot within that time, possession passes to the opposition and the shot clock is reset.

Water polo is an intensely physical sport; contact is permitted with players possessing the ball. Strength, endurance, power and strategy are therefore essential.",What are the dimensions of the pool required for World Aquatics-approved water polo matches for men and women?,5,"The dimensions for a World Aquatics-approved water polo pool for men are typically 30 meters in length and 20 meters in width, with a minimum depth of 2 meters. For women, the dimensions are usually slightly smaller at 25 meters in length and 17 meters in width, with the same minimum depth of 2 meters."
waterpolo,"Olympic History

Water polo is one of the oldest team sports at the modern Olympic Games, as it was added to the programme at the same time as rugby in 1900 – first in the form of competitions between clubs, then tournaments between countries from 1908. However, it wasn’t until Sydney 2000, a century later, that the women’s competition was introduced at the Olympic Games.

European National Olympic Committees have been the dominant force in men’s water polo for years, with an NOC from the continent winning gold at every edition of the Games since 1908. Hungary tops the men’s medal table with 16 medals (including nine golds).

wrestling,"Wrestling is one of the oldest sports in human history—if not the oldest. Multiple sculptures, reliefs and cave drawings—some of which date to around 15,000 years ago—show wrestlers using various holds that are still used in the present-day sport. Wrestling was a key part of the ancient Olympic Games, where it was first contested in 708 BCE. Wrestling matches were organised as its own event in two disciplines (‘upright’ and ‘ground’ wrestling) and as part of the pentathlon.

Modern wrestling consists of two separate disciplines: Greco-Roman wrestling, a wrestling style based on the ancient sport, and freestyle wrestling, a more modern format.",What are the two separate disciplines of modern wrestling?,5,The two separate disciplines of modern wrestling are freestyle wrestling and Greco-Roman wrestling.
wrestling,"Brief Overview of the Rules

There are two Olympic wrestling disciplines, each with its own rules. In Greco-Roman wrestling, a competitor can only use his arms and upper body to attack his opponent above the waist. Freestyle wrestling is a much more open form of the sport in which competitors also use their legs and can hold opponents above or below the waist.

However, the objective is the same in both styles. Contested on a circular combat area, a bout consists of two three-minute periods. Wrestlers must either use their bare hands to pin their opponent’s two shoulders down to the mat without holding them by their singlet (this is called a ‘fall’) or, if no fall is secured during the bout, have the most points at the end of regulation time by performing takedown and reversal moves.",What are the main differences between Greco-Roman wrestling and freestyle wrestling in terms of the rules of competition?,5,"One main difference between Greco-Roman wrestling and freestyle wrestling is that in Greco-Roman wrestling, wrestlers are not allowed to attack below the waist, while in freestyle wrestling, attacking below the waist is permitted. Additionally, Greco-Roman wrestling focuses more on upper body throws and takedowns, while freestyle wrestling allows for a wider range of techniques including leg attacks."
wrestling,"Olympic History

Greco-Roman wrestling has been a blue-ribbon Olympic event ever since the first modern Games were held in Athens in 1896. It became a permanent fixture on the Olympic programme in 1908. Freestyle wrestling made its debut a few years later at the St. Louis 1904 Games and has featured on the Olympic programme ever since the Antwerp 1920 Games. Women’s freestyle wrestling has been on the Olympic programme since the Athens 2004 Games.

Athletes representing the Soviet Union have won 116 medals at the Games, including 62 golds. Team USA athletes have secured 142 medals (57 golds).

diving,"Brief Overview of the Rules

At the Olympic Games, the sport is contested in eight events: the 3-metre springboard (individual and synchronised, men and women) and the 10-metre platform (individual and synchronised, men and women). The 3-metre springboard enables divers to leap high into the air, while the high dive is performed from a fixed platform position 10 metres above the water. The individual and synchronised competitions take place at both heights.

A panel of judges score each dive based on various criteria, including how aesthetically pleasing a diver’s movements are, the complexity of the dive and how well the diver enters the water. Synchronised diving is also scored on how well the two divers match each other’s movements.",How many events are contested in diving at the Olympic Games?,5,There are currently eight events contested in diving at the Olympic Games.

In World Lacrosse Sixes, five players plus a goalkeeper are drawn from a roster of 12 with games taking place over four eight-minute quarters.

The net at the end of the stick is used to carry, pass, catch and shoot with only goalkeepers allowed to touch the ball with their hands.

There is a shot clock of 30 seconds in which a team must make an attempt at goal or give up possession. A turnover also occurs if a team returns to its own half having moved into the attacking half.

Minor fouls result in a player being sent to the penalty box for 30 seconds with major fouls triggering a one-minute suspension.

athletics,"Brief Overview of the Rules

Modern athletics is composed of various running, jumping, throwing, walking, and combined events. Due to its many categories and disciplines, athletics involves the most participants in a single sport at the Olympic Games.

The track programme includes sprints, middle-distance and long-distance events as well as hurdles, steeplechase races, and relays for men and women. These events take place on the 400m oval track in the Olympic stadium (made up of two straights and two curved bends).

Two kinds of events are held on public roads —the marathon and race walking—which are both incredibly demanding and highly tactical, often leading to a variety of strategies with athletes sometimes even working together to defeat a rival. Spectators line the route to watch and cheer the athletes on.

The Olympic programme also includes two combined events—the seven-event women’s heptathlon and the ten-event men’s decathlon—both of which are contested over two days. Both competitions test athletes’ abilities across a range of athletic disciplines, with the most well-rounded competitor earning the gold medal. The disciplines are contested on, within, and around the track in the Olympic stadium, in the jumping area (high jump and pole vault), the jumping pit (long jump and triple jump), the throwing circle (shot put, discus and hammer throw), and the javelin runway. Athletes compete one after another, and the event includes a qualifying stage during which the best athletes secure their place in the final.",What are the two combined events that are included in the Olympic athletics programme?,5,Track and field events
